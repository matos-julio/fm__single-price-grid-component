## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM Methodology
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this small project i've tried to write my code using BEM Methodology and Custom properties on CSS, even is not a complex project, i'm trying to get used to it by using in every project i make, so when i really need it I won't have many issues.

Here are some examples:

```html -- using BEM
<section class="content content--dark-green">
  <h2 class="content__title">Monthly Subscription</h2>
</section>
```

```css -- using Custom properties
.pricing small,
.why-us {
  --clr-secondary-grey: hsl(201, 71%, 89%);
  color: var(--clr-secondary-grey);
}
```

### Continued development

My focus is to continue learning the methods i've used in this project and starting implementing Javascript in my next projects.
